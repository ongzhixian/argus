# Overview

An instance of IdentityServer


## OpenID Connect

IdentityServer can act as an OpenID Connect server.
But we are not implementing it in this branch (because it involve adding additional assets like controllers, views, wwwroot, ... etc.)
and these assets are not necessary for the basic workings of an idp.

TODO: Setup a `OpenIdConnect` branch to demonstrate `OpenID Connect` use case.
